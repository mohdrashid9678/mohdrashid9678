# Hi there, I'm Mohd Zahid 👋

I'm a backend-focused Software Engineer with over **1.5 years of industry experience** building scalable, maintainable systems using **JavaScript / TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Go**, and cloud-native technologies.

My passion lies in **distributed systems**, **event-driven-architectures**, and **fault-tolerant architectures**. I'm actively seeking opportunities to design and build resilient backend infrastructure and deepen my expertise in these areas.

* **Performance Optimization:** Re-architected and optimized reporting APIs, reducing latency by **60%** and boosting overall system performance.
* **Developer Efficiency:** Pioneered a local test execution environment with **dynamic Docker images**, which reduced development time by **30-40%** and lowered **AWS** costs.
* **Integration & Pipelines:** Engineered a feature to import data from **Postman** and created a generic data transformation pipeline.
* **Product Development:** Drove the development of multiple product features from initial design to final deployment.
